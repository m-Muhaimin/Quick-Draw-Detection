# Quick-Draw-Detection
This project aims to classify images from the "quickdraw_bitmap" dataset into 10 categories using two models, LSTM and CNN. The LSTM model processes sequential data while the CNN model extracts spatial features. By switching between these models, we achieve accurate classification results.
